    "In this unit we write a poker program. This is an example of a general process where we start with a vague understanding of the problem and then we refine our understanding so that it has a formal specification, then we specify that into something that is amenable to be coded, and we end up with working code. In a diagram this looks like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "The first thing we need to do is to make an *inventory* of the concepts we will have to deal with.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hands**: a hand consists of 5 cards. A card has a rank and a suit. The program we are trying to write takes a *list of hands* and returns the *best hand*.\n",
    "2. In order to select the best hand we need to *rank* hands. Another concept is, therefore, **hand rank**. What are the concepts that make a hand rank? This [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands) details all the rules of poker, but we are primarily interested in the following three concepts:\n",
    "   1. **n-kind**: when a hand contains $n$ cards of the same *rank* (not suit).\n",
    "   2. **straight**: when we have *5 consecutive ranks*.\n",
    "   3. **flush**: when all 5 cards have the same suit, and the ranks don't matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are ready to move to the desigh phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Representing hands\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a good representation of a hand? Consider these three examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `['JS', 'JD', '2S', '2C', '7H']`\n",
    "- `[(11, 'S'), (11, 'D'), (2, 'S'), (2, 'C'), (7, 'H')]`\n",
    "- `set(['JS', 'JD', '2S', '2C', '7H'])`\n",
    "- `'JS JS 2S 2C 7H'`\n",
    "\n",
    "Which one(s) are best suited to our problem? Which ones are not? The set representation wouldn't work if we used two decks, otherwise all the above representations will work, if not with the same efficacy. For example, the first and the last one are equivalent, but for the string representation you will need to call `split()`. Overall, the first two are the best ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The `poker()` function\n",
    "\n",
    "We can start thinking about the `poker()` function. Out of a list of hands, this function should return the highest ranking hand, therefore we can intuitively imagine that a call to `max()` should appear here."

    "## Hand Rank Attempt\n",
    "\n",
    "This is our most complicated function. It takes a hand, but what does it return? It should return a value that is comparable by `max()`, but we don't yet know what it should be. Why not a number? We can rank hands from 0 to 8, with 0 for an empty hand and 8 for a Straight Flush (note, we are not considering Royal Flushes). We know it is going to be important to look at ranks, so let's imagine we have written a function `card_ranks()` that returns the ranks of the cards in a hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may start enumerating all the cases, starting from a Straight Flush and moving on. Note that in the definition below we are including several functions we have not yet defined, like `straight()`, `flush()` and `kind(n, ranks)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def hand_rank(hand):\n",
    "    \"Return a value indicating the ranking of a hand.\"\n",
    "    ranks = card_ranks(hand) # We haven't written this one yet.\n",
    "    if straight(ranks) and flush(hand):\n",
    "        return 8\n",
    "    elif kind(4, ranks):\n",
    "        return 7\n",
    "    # etc etc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The question is, would such a function work? The answer is, sometimes it would, and sometimes it would not. It would work for comparisons between a full house and a straight, for example, but what if two players had a pair of 10s and of 9s respectively. We need to disambiguate and rank these two pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Representing Rank\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a better way to represent rank. There are several possibilities. We may continue to use integers, but bigger ones. For example, if we have two four-of-a-kind hands, with ranks [9, 9, 9, 9, 5] and [3, 3, 3, 3, 2] respectively. In the formulation above they would be both ranked as 7. We may represent them as 70905 and 70302, respectively. The first digit would be the rank, the third the rank of the four cards, and the last digit the rank of the remaining card. The zeros allow for ranks greater than 9.\n",
    "We could otherwise use real numbers, like 7.0905 and 7.0302. Or we could use tuples like (7, 9, 5) and (7, 3, 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "All these representations would actually work, and `max()` would do the right thing, but the tuple-based representation is the most convenient, since the other require fairly complicated arithmetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ordering in Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to compare tuples. Tuples are compared element by element, just like strings. This is called **lexigraphic ordering**. Let's look at some examples."
