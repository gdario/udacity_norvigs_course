    "# Lesson 4\n",
    "\n",
    "This unit is about solving problems where the solution can be expressed as a sequence of steps. The unit starts at [video 229](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6M_pco_5Vo&list=PLAwxTw4SYaPnJVtPvZZ5zXj_wRBjH0FxX&index=229&pp=iAQB).\n",

    "## The Pouring Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two glasses that can contain 9 and 4 oz of water respectively, and we have a faucet and a sink where we can refill or empty either glass. The final goal is to have exactly 6 oz of water in the larger glass. The small one can contain any amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 6 possible actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pouring from glass X to glass Y.\n",
    "2. Pouring from glass Y to glass X.\n",
    "3. Filling glass X.\n",
    "4. Filling glass Y.\n",
    "5. Emptying glass X.\n",
    "6. Emptying glass Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to transfer from X to Y and vice-versa. We can pour from X to Y until\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Y is full.\n",
    "2. X is empty. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Inventory of Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Collection of glasses (we start with two but we can generalize).\n",
    "2. Total capacity of glass Z (Z $\\in$ {X, Y}).\n",
    "3. Current water level in glass Z.\n",
    "4. Our goal (6 oz in the large glass).\n",
    "5. The six pouring actions.\n",
    "6. A notion of a _solution_. For us, a solution is a sequence of steps from the initial to the goal configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The collection of glasses and their current level provides a complete description of the current state of the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combinatorial Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "For each state of the world there are approximately six possible actions (not all possible at all times). If the solution requires $n$ steps, there are in the order of $n^6$ possible configurations. However we don't know in advance the value of $n$, so the actual complexity of the problem is not known in advance. These are examples of **combinatorial optimization** but we will refer to them as **search** problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploring the Space\n",
    "\n",
    "Our solution is a collection of states, where X = 6 and Y can be anything between 0 and 4 inclusive. At any given step of the exploration, the farthest states we have explored represent the **frontier**. We can then distinguish three sets of states.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The goal state(s).\n",
    "2. The explored states that represent the frontier.\n",
    "3. The explored states that are not in the frontier.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find a solution, we keep expanding the frontier until it overlaps one of the solution states. In this kind of problems there are two sitations we want to be able to deal with:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When there is no path from the frontier to the solution.\n",
    "2. If there is a path, we want to be able to find it efficiently, and we want to avoid ending in an infinite loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is a finite number of states, and if there is a path from the start configuration to the solution, we should be able to find it. We want a strategy, i.e., criteria to decide which states we will explore next.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define **successors** the set of states you can reach from a given state, and the steps needed to get to those states.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use `X` and `Y` to indicate the total capacity of the glasses and `x` and `y` to indicate their current level. We represent our paths as lists containing an alternation of states and actions: `[state, action, state, ...]`. The frontier is technically a set of states, but we represent it as a list of _paths_. If no solution is found, we return an empty list (for consistency with the success case).\n",
    "\n",
    "### MY QUESTIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.: Why do we need `new_path`? Can't we just append to `path`?\n",
    "A.: No, we cannot. If we did, this would happen: let's consider the case where line 19 returns $k$ states with $k > 1$, none of which is in `explored` yet. We update `path = path + [action, state]` and we append it to the frontier. We then consider the next successor, and we do the same thing. This would append the new `[action, state]` pair to the one we appended in the previous step, which is clearly wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The `successors` function returns a dictionary of `state: action` pairs."
