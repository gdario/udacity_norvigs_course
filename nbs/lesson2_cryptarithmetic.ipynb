    "An example of cryptarithmetic is the equation\n",

    " ODD +\n",
    " ODD =\n",

    "where each letter represents a digit and where the equation holds true. First consideration: if the numbers are in base 10, ODD must be greater than 500. It cannot be 500 because this would mean O=5, D=0, and 1000 should be XDDD (we don't yet know X). Also D must be > 5, since there clearly is a carry digit. We also realize that E = 1, because ODD must be <= 999 (it cannot be 999, since the digits are different), so the sum must be strictly lower than 2000. So, the first and third digits must be 1. N must be an even number, since it's the unitary part of 2*D. Using some more inferences we can come up with two solutions: 655 + 655 = 1310 or 855 + 855 = 1710.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Brute Force Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "One possible approach could be implementing all the rules of arithmetc (carry digits, odd/even). This is a challenging task, even just for addition. We would like to find a shortcut. Another possibility would be trying all possibilities. Given 10 digits there are $10! \\approx 3\\times10^6$, this seems feasible, although not fast. For each of the letters, we can consider each of the $10!$ permuatations of the digits. We would replace the letters with the values and keep iterating until the equation holds.\n",

    "## Inventory of Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "We are dealing with the following concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Equations. Two types: the original ones (with letters), and the \"filled-in\" (with digits).\n",
    "2. Letters.\n",
    "3. Digits.\n",
    "4. Assignment of a letter to a digit.\n",
    "5. Evaluation or validation that the equation is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we represent these concepts? Norvig suggests this approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The original equation can be expressed as a string.\n",
    "- The filled-in equation can also be represented as a string.\n",
    "- The letters are single characters (one-character strings).\n",
    "- The numbers are also represented as single characters.\n",
    "- We need a mapping that associates letters to numbers. We can leverage `str.translate()`.\n",
    "- For the evaluation we can use `eval()`, that takes a string and evaluates it as an expression.\n",
