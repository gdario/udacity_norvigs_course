    "## The Zebra Puzzle\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider a famous puzzle known as the [Zebra Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_Puzzle).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are five houses.\n",
    "2. The Englishman lives in the red house.\n",
    "3. The Spaniard owns the dog.\n",
    "4. Coffee is drunk in the green house.\n",
    "5. The Ukrainian drinks tea.\n",
    "6. The green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house.\n",
    "7. The Old Gold smoker owns snails.\n",
    "8. Kools are smoked in the yellow house.\n",
    "9. Milk is drunk in the middle house.\n",
    "10. The Norwegian lives in the first house.\n",
    "11. The man who smokes Chesterfields lives in the house next to the man with the fox.\n",
    "12. Kools are smoked in the house next to the house where the horse is kept.\n",
    "13. The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice.\n",
    "14. The Japanese smokes Parliaments.\n",
    "15. The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, who drinks water? Who owns the zebra? \n",
    "\n",
    "We will develop a solution, discuss whether it is good enough, whether brute-force would work here, and do some back-of-the-envelope calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concept Inventory\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, we start making an inventory of the relevant concepts we need to deal with. The first concept is **houses**: there are 5 of them. Then there are **properties** of the inhabitants of these houses, and precisely:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nationality\n",
    "- Color of the house they live in.\n",
    "- Pets they own.\n",
    "- Drinks they drink.\n",
    "- What they smoke.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then there is a notion of **assignment** of the properties to houses. We can think of assigning, say, **color** blue to house number two, or Englishman to the red house. There is the **location** of the house (the first one, the middle one, etc, the house on the right or next to another house, and so on.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The question is now, do we need to separate out the different types of assignment?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Property name / description: Nationality / lived in.\n",
    "- Do we just need the notion of a property group? For example, the Englishman, Norwegian, Japanese, Spaniard, and Ukranian belong to the same property, but we don't need to name it that way.\n",
    "- Can we ignore this notion of grouping altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two choices would both be reasonable choices, but the third one would not. For example, if red is assigned to house n.2, then blue cannot be assigned to house n.2, but orange juice can be assigned to house n.2. There is therefore an idea that properties inside a group are mutually exclusive and properties outside of a group are not, and this is an important concept to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key point is getting the assignments right. It requires a lot of clever reasoning, but we want to try a \"trial and error\" apperoach. If we put the Englishman in house 1, where can we put the Spaniard? Since they are members of the same property group, i.e., nationality, they cannot be in the same house, therefore we can place the Spaniard in house 2, 3, 4, or 5. For a single property group there are $5!$ possibilities. Since we have 5 property groups, we have ${5!}^5 = 24883200000$ possibilities, i.e., almost 25 billion! A back of the envelop estimate would be the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $5! = 120 \\approx 10^2$\n",
    "- ${5!}^5 \\approx {10^2}^5 = 10^{10}$\n",
    "- We have approximated down from 120 to 100 in the beginning, so we may need to approximate up. Let's say 20 billion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern computers can roughly do 1 billion operations per second on a \"good second\", i.e., one without page faults or cache misses. If we were in the range of millions, we would be fine. This is the \"happy valley of computation\". If we were in the range of trillions, we could say upfront that the brute force approach is not feasible. We are in the middle, so it's not clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we represent assignment? Here are three possibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We represent houses as an array of sets, i.e., `house[1].add('red')`.\n",
    "2. We represent houses as classes with properties, i.e., `house[1].color = 'red'`.\n",
    "3. We just assign the house number to a `red` variable, i.e., `red = 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "All three would work, but the last one is simpler, and we will go with this one, at least as long as we don't have evidence that it is *too* simple, and that we need something more complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below would take hours to run, so don't try to call `zebra_puzzle()`."

    "Using a generator expression has a few advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It requires less indentation than would be necessary if we wrote all the `if` and `for` statements.\n",
    "2. It does not need to perform all computations, as would be the case for a list comprehension. In other words, generator expressions can stop early.\n",
    "3. It is easier to edit, for example organizing the constraints as shown above. We have an aligned structure rather than a nested indentation, so we can move things up and down as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program above is slow because it runs through all the $5!^5$ combinations, and then it filters them out. We can make the code above a bit faster. For example, the first two `for` statements go through the orderings of house color and nationality. The first `if` statement checks whether the Englishman lives in the red house. If he does not, there is no point in going through the other `for` loops, therefore, we can move that `if` statement to line 23.\n",
